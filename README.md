<!--- replace the NPM URL to my Portfolio's URL -->

**[Separate Country Code & Number](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dhavalveera/separate-country-code-n-number) is used to separate the country ISD Code & Phone Number from the string, and returns Country Code, Phone Number & Country separately.**

If you don't have time to write the code to separate the country code & number from a single string, we offer the solution where you can get the Country ISD Code, Country Name & Phone Number separately with this tiny package.
